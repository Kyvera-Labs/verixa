# Password Storage

Verixa hashes passwords with **argon2id** at OWASP's recommended minimum
parameters, through a port so the algorithm can be replaced without touching
application code.

Implementation: `packages/credentials/infrastructure/argon2-password-hasher.ts`.

## The rule

**Never store a password. Store a hash, and compare hashes.**

More precisely: store the output of a _password hashing function_ — a
deliberately slow, memory-hard KDF. Not encryption (which is reversible, and
the key will leak with the database), and not a general-purpose cryptographic
hash.

## Why argon2id

argon2 has three variants:

| Variant      | Strength                                                | Weakness                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| argon2d      | Best GPU/TMTO resistance                                | Vulnerable to side channels          |
| argon2i      | Side-channel resistant                                  | Weaker against time-memory tradeoffs |
| **argon2id** | **Runs argon2i for the first half pass, argon2d after** | **Neither extreme, most of both**    |

RFC 9106 names argon2id the default choice. Pick it unless you have a
specific reason not to.

### Against bcrypt and scrypt

bcrypt is not broken and remains defensible. Two real limits:

- **A fixed ~4 MiB working set** that cannot be raised. It has not become
  meaningfully harder to attack as hardware improved, because the one
  parameter that matters most against specialized hardware is the one bcrypt
  cannot change.
- **72-byte input truncation.** Anything past 72 bytes is silently ignored,
  turning a long passphrase into a shorter one with no error. Our test suite
  asserts argon2 has no such limit rather than assuming it.

scrypt is memory-hard and fine. argon2id is the newer design that won the
Password Hashing Competition and addressed scrypt's tradeoffs directly.

### What actually matters

The choice among argon2id, scrypt, and bcrypt is a detail. **Using anything
else is the failure.**

MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512 and every other general-purpose hash are wrong
here, salted or not. They are engineered to be _fast_ — which is precisely
the property you do not want when an attacker holds your database and is
making billions of guesses per second on rented GPUs. A salt stops
precomputed rainbow tables; it does nothing about raw guessing speed.

If you see any of these hashing a password in a PR, reject it.

## Parameters

```ts
export const DEFAULT_ARGON2_PARAMETERS = {
  memoryCost: 19_456, // 19 MiB per hash
  timeCost: 2, // passes over memory
  parallelism: 1, // lanes
};
```

These are OWASP's current **minimum**, so treat them as a floor rather than a
target.

**`memoryCost` is the parameter that matters.** argon2's resistance to
specialized cracking hardware comes from forcing each guess to allocate real
memory. A GPU with thousands of cores has nowhere near thousands of times the
memory bandwidth, so memory-hardness is what stops an attacker trading
silicon for speed. Raising `timeCost` alone buys much less.

### Tuning for your hardware

Raise `memoryCost` until a single hash takes as long as your latency budget
allows — commonly 50–250ms on a login path.

Two constraints to respect:

1. **Memory is per concurrent hash.** At 19 MiB, 100 simultaneous logins need
   ~1.9 GiB. Raising memory without checking peak concurrency is how you turn
   a login spike into an OOM kill.
2. **Login is on the critical path.** A 500ms hash is 500ms every user waits.

The constructor rejects obviously-too-weak parameters. Misconfiguration is
the realistic failure mode here — not a flawed algorithm — and a hasher
running at 1 KiB is indistinguishable from a correct one from the outside,
until someone dumps the database.

## Salting

Handled by the library: a fresh 16-byte CSPRNG salt per call, stored inside
the hash string. There is no API to supply your own, which is correct.

Without a per-hash salt, two users with the same password get the same hash —
so cracking one cracks both, and the database itself shows an attacker which
accounts to attack together.

## Peppering — not implemented, deliberately

A _pepper_ is a server-side secret mixed in before hashing, held outside the
database (ideally in a KMS). It means a database-only disclosure yields
hashes that cannot be attacked at all without also obtaining the pepper.

Verixa does not implement one yet. The protection is real but so is the cost:
rotating a pepper requires re-hashing every password, which can only happen
as users log in, so you carry two peppers through a long transition. Adding
it before there is a KMS to hold the secret would mean a "pepper" sitting in
an environment variable next to the database URL — protecting against exactly
nothing.

The `PasswordHasher` port is the seam where a pepper would be added, and
adding one later requires no change above it.

## The stored format, and why it matters

```
$argon2id$v=19$m=19456,t=2,p=1$<base64 salt>$<base64 hash>
```

This PHC string is **self-describing**: algorithm, version, parameters and
salt all travel with the digest.

That is what makes parameter changes survivable. An old hash carries the
parameters it was created with, so it remains verifiable years after the
defaults moved. Storing a bare digest and keeping parameters in config would
make every parameter change a forced password reset for every user.

## Upgrading hashes over time

Cost parameters must rise as hardware improves. But existing hashes cannot be
recomputed — the plaintext is gone.

The only moment it exists is **a successful login**:

```ts
if (await hasher.verify(password, credential.hash)) {
  if (hasher.needsRehash(credential.hash)) {
    await credentials.save(credential.withHash(await hasher.hash(password)));
  }
  // ... continue login
}
```

Passwords upgrade gradually, as people sign in. No reset emails, nothing for
the user to notice.

**`needsRehash` only reports upgrades, never downgrades.** If someone lowers a
parameter to shed load, "different parameters" would silently re-hash every
password _down_ to the weaker setting on next login — degrading the entire
system while looking like routine maintenance. Only increases propagate.

## Things this layer does _not_ do

Worth stating, because assuming otherwise is how gaps appear:

- **It does not prevent user enumeration.** Verifying a password for a
  nonexistent user returns immediately, while a real user pays the full KDF
  cost — a timing difference that reveals which addresses are registered. The
  fix belongs in the login use case: hash against a dummy value when no user
  is found, so both paths cost the same.
- **It does not rate-limit.** An attacker who can make unlimited attempts does
  not need to crack your hashes. Phases 11 and 15.
- **It does not check password strength.** That is Issue 062's
  `RawPassword` policy — length over complexity rules, and a breach-list
  check, per NIST 800-63B.
- **It does not log.** Nothing here should ever appear in a log line. A
  password reaching a logger is a disclosure regardless of what happens next.

## Dormant accounts: the password upgrade gap

Cost parameters must rise as hardware improves, but existing hashes cannot be recomputed without
the plaintext. The upgrade path above (successful login checking `needsRehash` and upgrading)
handles accounts that log in. **It does not handle dormant, seasonal, or rare accounts whose
hash sits at whatever cost parameters were current when they last logged in, potentially years
out of date.**

For these accounts, the plaintext never arrives — there is no login moment to catch it in. Three
approaches exist:

### Approach 1: Hash-over-Hash (Rejected)

Store `argon2(current_params, existing_hash)`, record that a wrapping layer exists (schema field),
and update the verify path to apply layers in order.

**Pro:** Upgrades every dormant account with no user involvement. Closes the gap completely.

**Con:** Introduces significant operational complexity:
- Schema change to track wrapping layers (versioning problem)
- Verify path becomes stateful — must apply layers in correct order
- Creates future migration debt if the wrapping scheme needs to change
- No existing patterns in this codebase for layered hashing operations
- One miscalculation at the verify layer can lock users out of their own accounts permanently

**Why rejected:** This codebase has no background job infrastructure, no existing patterns for
layered operations, and is at early production maturity. The complexity is real and doesn't pay
for itself until the measurement reveals the problem is severe enough to warrant it. Start with
visibility first.

### Approach 2: Forced Reset After Staleness Threshold (Rejected)

Invalidate hashes below a parameter generation/age threshold and route the owner through password
reset.

**Pro:** Simple, unambiguous, produces a genuinely fresh hash. Existing password-reset
infrastructure is ready (Issue 069).

**Con:** Sends unsolicited password-reset emails to dormant accounts, which reads as a phishing
attempt and trains users to distrust password-reset emails from this product.

**Important distinction:** This is NOT routine password rotation (which NIST 800-63B explicitly
argues against). This is a one-time security-parameter catch-up for accounts that structurally
cannot be caught any other way. However, the operational cost is real: it requires building a
background job or mass-email system that does not exist yet. Premature infrastructure investment
for an uncertain problem.

**Why rejected:** Requires background job infrastructure that doesn't exist yet. The UX cost
(unsolicited security emails) is real and should only be paid if measurement shows the gap is
severe. Building jobs for this single purpose is premature.

### Approach 3: Do Nothing, Deliberately Measure (Chosen)

Accept the gap as a known, quantified engineering position rather than an unmeasured one. Add a
query/metric exposing:
- Count of credentials below current cost parameters
- Age distribution: oldest credential, median age, distribution if applicable

**Pro:** Honest about the gap. Turns unknown into known. Measurement enables better future
decisions. Requires minimal code and no new infrastructure.

**Con:** Does not close the gap immediately. Dormant accounts remain at older cost parameters
until (if) one of the other approaches is implemented later.

**Why chosen:** At early production maturity (no background job system, no metrics infrastructure),
measurement is the appropriate response. Once the measurement lands:
- If the gap is small (few old accounts), it doesn't warrant the complexity of Options 1 or 2.
- If the gap is large, the team has data to justify building background jobs for Option 2 or
  committing to the layered-hash complexity of Option 1.
- If background jobs are built for other reasons (audit log retention, Phase 24), Option 2 becomes
  cheap to add.

The measurement query is a fully acceptable outcome per the issue requirements, and it is the
right call for this stage of the product.

## Review checklist

For any PR touching credentials:

- [ ] No general-purpose hash (MD5/SHA-*) used for a password
- [ ] No plaintext password stored, logged, or included in an error message
- [ ] Cost parameters come from config, not hard-coded at a call site
- [ ] `needsRehash` is checked after a successful verify
- [ ] Verification failures are indistinguishable to the client — wrong
      password, unknown user, and malformed stored hash all look the same
- [ ] No password in a URL, query string, or `GET` request
- [ ] Tests cover the wrong-password path, not only the happy path
