 * point of a compare-and-set is that losing the race is a normal outcome with
 * a defined response (re-read the head, relink, try again). A caller that has
 * to wrap every audit write in a `try` to discover this either swallows it or
 * crashes, and neither is what you want from the security-relevant log.
 *
 * Carries both hashes, because the difference between them is the diagnosis:
 * `expected` is what the writer thought it was appending to, `actual` is what
 * the chain head really is. If they differ, a concurrent writer won; if
 * `actual` is a hash the caller has never seen, something else is wrong and

 * Retention and erasure (Phase 24) are a different problem with different
 * rules, and will arrive as an explicit, auditable operation rather than as a
 * method that was quietly always there.
 *
 * ## Why every append carries `expectedPreviousHash`
 *
 * A new entry commits to its predecessor's hash, so writing one is only safe
 * if you know what the predecessor is. The naive sequence — read the head,
 * build an entry, insert it — has a window between the read and the insert in
 * which another writer can extend the chain, producing two entries that claim
 * the same predecessor and a forked chain in which one branch is silently
 * unreachable.
 *
 * So the read is not trusted: the insert re-checks it and reports
 * {@link ChainConflictError} when the head has moved. Callers react by
 * re-reading and retrying, and the chain can only ever extend linearly.
