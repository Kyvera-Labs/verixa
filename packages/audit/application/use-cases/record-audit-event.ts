 * Anything that takes an audit record for a domain event that happened.
 *
 * ## Why this is a port when one implementation already existed
 *
 * `RecordAuditEvent` writes synchronously: it returns once the entry is in the
 * log. `BatchedAuditWriter` returns once the entry is *queued*, which is the
 * whole point of it under load. Those are different latencies with the same
 * meaning to the caller -- "this event was offered for recording" -- and no route
 * in `apps/api` should have to know which one was wired. Without the port,
 * turning batching on means editing every call site.
 *
 * ## What implementations owe the caller
 *
 * `execute` resolves with the entry that was written, or `undefined` when nothing
 * was written. It must never reject: the operation being audited already
 * succeeded, and an audit failure reported as a thrown error converts a
 * bookkeeping problem into a user-facing outage.
 *
 * `undefined` therefore covers three different situations -- a transient write
 * failure, a lost race, and a full queue -- and they are not distinguishable from
 * the return value by design. Anything that needs to tell them apart is a metrics
 * consumer and should read the writer's overflow and failure reports instead of
 * inferring them from a route.

/**
 * Appends one entry to the audit log.
 *
 * ## Why this returns nothing and throws nothing
 *
 * Audit recording sits alongside the operation being audited, not in front of
 * it. A login that succeeded should not be reported as failed because the
 * audit write failed, and a caller should not have to decide what to do about
 * it — so failures are swallowed here and reported through the logger.
 *
 * That is a real trade and worth being explicit about: it means an attacker
 * who can reliably break audit writes can act unrecorded. The mitigation is
 * not to fail the user's request, which mostly produces an outage; it is that
 * a gap in the sequence is *visible* — `verifyChain` reports `sequence_gap`,
 * and the anchored chain head will not match what the operator expects.
 *
 * ## Serialization
 *
 * Appends must not run concurrently. Two entries built from the same
 * predecessor produce two chains claiming the same sequence, and the second
 * insert fails on the unique index — which is the correct outcome, but only
 * because the index is there. This is why `sequence` is unique in the schema
 * rather than merely indexed.
 *
 * The repository turns that failure into a `ChainConflictError` rather than
 * leaving it as a database error, and this class is where the *response* lives:
 * re-read the head, relink onto it, try again. Retrying is safe precisely
 * because the losing append never landed — the retry is not writing a second
 * entry, it is completing the one the caller asked for.
 *
 * Bounded, because an unbounded retry loop under sustained contention is a
 * memory and CPU leak that turns a throughput problem into an outage. Giving
 * up and reporting through `onError` is the right endpoint: a missing audit
 * entry is bad, a wedged process is worse, and the gap is detectable either
 * way.
