 *
 * ## Why entries are chained rather than merely timestamped
 *
 * An audit log that is just rows in a table proves nothing against the one
 * adversary it most needs to resist: someone with write access to that table.
 * They can delete the row recording what they did, or edit it, and no
 * evidence of the change remains.
 *
 * Each entry therefore commits to its predecessor: `hash = SHA256(previous
 * hash ‖ this entry's content)`. Removing or altering any entry breaks every
 * hash after it, so tampering is no longer a matter of editing one row — it
 * requires rewriting the entire log from that point forward.
 *
 * ## What chaining alone does *not* give you
 *
 * Exactly that: it requires rewriting the log, and an attacker with full
 * database access can do precisely that. A rewritten chain is internally
 * consistent and indistinguishable from an honest one.
 *
 * Chaining makes the log tamper-**evident** to anyone holding an earlier copy
 * of a hash. It does not make it tamper-**proof**. Closing that gap needs a
 * commitment stored somewhere the operator cannot rewrite, which is what
 * anchoring the chain head to Stellar is for — see
 * `docs/adr/0003-stellar-audit-anchoring.md`. The two mechanisms are
 * complementary and neither is sufficient alone, which is worth stating
 * plainly because "we hash-chain our audit log" is frequently claimed as
 * though it were the whole answer.
 *
 * ## No update or delete
 *
 * There is deliberately no method to modify an entry. Append-only is the
 * property being protected, and an aggregate that could edit itself would
 * make the chain a formality.
