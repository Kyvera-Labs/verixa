/**
 * Changes the authenticated user's password, requiring re-entry of the current one.
 *
 * Distinct from `ConfirmPasswordReset` (Issue 070) — that is for account
 * recovery when the current password is forgotten. This is for a logged-in
 * user rotating their own password, as a convenience and as part of regular
 * security hygiene.
 *
 * Re-authentication (current password re-entry) is deliberate. A user in an
 * unlocked browser at a coffee shop wants to know that a password change will
 * not go through while they grab a napkin. The complexity is real and the
 * property is also real. Phase 06 will extend this to MFA step-up as another
 * example of re-authentication.
 *
 * Password reuse is rejected (Issue 072): one of the last N passwords cannot
 * be used. This prevents trivial "change and change back" bypasses.
