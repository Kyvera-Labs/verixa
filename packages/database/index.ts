// Re-exports the generated Prisma client as this package's public surface, so
// consumers import `@verixa/database` rather than `@prisma/client` directly.
// That indirection is what lets the ORM choice stay an infrastructure detail:
// only this package and the repository adapters that implement Phase 02's
// ports ever see Prisma types, and the domain/application layers never do.
//
// The client is generated, not committed — it's platform-specific (it ships a
// compiled query-engine binary for the machine that generated it), so
// `pnpm db:generate` must run after a fresh clone and any time the schema
// changes. See docs/guides/database.md.
// Loaded through createRequire rather than a static `export ... from`.
//
// The generated Prisma client is CommonJS, and Node's ESM loader can only
// statically analyse named exports from CJS when they are assigned in a form
// its lexer recognises. Prisma builds its exports dynamically, so the lexer
// finds nothing and `export { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client"` throws at
// import time with "Named export not found".
//
// This never surfaced in tests — Vitest transforms modules rather than using
// Node's ESM loader — nor in `pnpm build`, since it is purely a runtime
// resolution concern. It appeared the moment a real `node dist/server.js`
// imported this package, which is why wiring the composition root into the
// server was worth doing on its own.
