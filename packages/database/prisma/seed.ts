/**
 * Deterministic development fixtures.
 *
 * Run with `pnpm db:seed`. Safe to run repeatedly: every record is upserted
 * against a fixed id, so a second run updates rather than duplicating. That
 * property is not a nicety — a seed you're afraid to re-run becomes a seed
 * nobody runs, and the fixtures drift out of sync with the schema until they
 * no longer work at all.
 *
 * ## This data is for local development only
 *
 * Every value here is obviously, deliberately fake: `@example.com` addresses
 * (an IANA-reserved domain that can never receive mail), names that read as
 * placeholders, and no secrets of any kind.
 *
 * That last part matters more than it looks. Seed files are copied,
 * committed, pasted into issues, and screenshotted in tutorials — so anything
 * in one should be worthless if disclosed. The failure mode isn't a leaked
 * seed password; it's that a realistic-looking one teaches the wrong habit
 * and eventually gets pasted somewhere real, or that a deployment
 * accidentally seeds a staging box with credentials someone then relies on.
 * Nothing here should ever be usable as a credential.
 *
 * There are no passwords yet because credentials arrive in Phase 04. When
 * they do, seeded accounts must use passwords that are clearly fake and
 * documented as unusable outside local development — never something that
 * looks like a real one.

/**
 * Fixed ids, not random ones.
 *
 * Deterministic ids are what make the seed idempotent, and they also make
 * fixtures referenceable: a contributor debugging locally can point at
 * `00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001` and know exactly which user that is,
 * across resets and across machines. Random ids would change every run and be
 * useless in a bug report.
 *
 * The `4` and `8` in the third and fourth groups keep these valid UUIDv4s, so
 * anything that validates the format still accepts them.
