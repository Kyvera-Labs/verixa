 * are enough to validate them without a database round trip, which is the
 * whole reason to use them. But that same statelessness means revoking one
 * (logout, "logout everywhere", a detected refresh-token reuse) can't be done
 * by deleting a row: the token is still cryptographically valid until it
 * expires on its own. `RevocationList` is the side channel that closes that
 * gap — a revoked session's id is recorded here, with a TTL no longer than
 * the access token's own lifetime, and checked alongside signature
 * verification. See `docs/security/threat-model-sessions.md`.
 *
 * Redis-backed in production (`RedisRevocationList`) because the check sits
 * on every authenticated request's hot path and a TTL is exactly what Redis
 * keys already do — no cleanup job needed, an entry simply expires once the
 * access token it was blocking would have expired anyway.

/**
 * A short-lived deny-list of revoked sessions, consulted on every access-token
 * verification.
 *
 * ## The problem this exists to solve
 *
 * Access tokens are stateless (see {@link
 * import("./token-signer.js").TokenSigner}): they verify without a store
 * lookup, which is what makes them cheap. The flip side is the textbook
 * stateless-JWT question — *how do you revoke something you never stored?* You
 * can delete the session row, but the access token already in an attacker's
 * hands keeps verifying until its `exp`, because verification never looks at
 * that row.
 *
 * The answer here is not "make access tokens stateful" (that throws away the
 * reason they exist). It is a **deny-list**: a small set of session ids whose
 * still-unexpired access tokens must be refused. On revocation, the session id
 * goes on the list; on every verification, the list is checked; and each entry
 * is set to expire at the same time the last access token for that session
 * would have anyway. Once no live token could reference a session, its entry is
 * pointless and evicts itself — so the list's size is bounded by the
 * access-token TTL, not by how many sessions have ever been revoked.
 *
 * ## Why the caller passes the TTL
 *
 * `revoke` takes the remaining lifetime rather than computing it, because only
 * the caller knows the access-token TTL in force when the token being revoked
 * was issued. An entry that expires too *early* re-opens the revocation window;
 * one that expires too *late* just wastes a little memory. When in doubt, round
 * up — correctness sits on the generous side.
 *
 * ## Availability tradeoff (fail-closed)
 *
 * An adapter backed by an external store (Redis, Issue 088) has to decide what
 * `isRevoked` does when that store is unreachable. This port does not dictate
 * the answer, but it does constrain how it is expressed: `isRevoked` returns a
 * plain boolean, so an adapter that chooses to **fail closed** — treat "cannot
 * check" as "assume revoked" — reports `true` rather than throwing. That trades
 * availability for safety, and the choice is documented at the adapter. See
 * `docs/security/token-design.md`.

 * The deny-list for access tokens that must stop working before they would

 *
 * Access tokens are stateless JWTs, verified without a database round trip

 * revocable" are in tension: a JWT that is valid until its `exp` claim keeps
 * working everywhere it is presented, including after `Logout`, unless
 * *something* stateful can say "no, not this one." This is that something.

 * `tokenId` is what closes that window; see `Logout`.
