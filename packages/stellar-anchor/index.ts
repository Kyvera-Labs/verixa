// It imports `vitest`, and this file is a *runtime* entry point. Exporting it
// meant that merely importing `@verixa/stellar-anchor` in a production process
// loaded vitest, which then threw "Vitest failed to access its internal state"
// and killed the process at startup — a failure no test could catch, because
// under vitest the import succeeds.
//
// The intent behind exporting it was sound: any future HashAnchor
// implementation should be able to prove it behaves identically rather than
// merely compiling against the same interface. Both existing consumers reach
// it by relative path, which is enough for now. Giving it a `./testing`
// subpath export is the right answer if an out-of-repo implementation ever
// needs it, and that is a packaging change rather than a line in this file.
