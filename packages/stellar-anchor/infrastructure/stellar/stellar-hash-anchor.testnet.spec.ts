/**
 * Exercises the real Stellar testnet: generates a throwaway account, funds it
 * from friendbot, and submits actual transactions to a real ledger.
 *
 * Excluded from the default `pnpm test` run (see `vitest.config.ts`) because
 * it needs network access and takes tens of seconds — run it deliberately
 * with `pnpm stellar:testnet`. It is not a unit test and shouldn't pretend to
 * be one; what it buys is the one thing the in-memory fake structurally
 * cannot prove, which is that the Stellar mechanics themselves are correct:
 * that a 32-byte MEMO_HASH really does round-trip through submission and
 * Horizon retrieval unchanged.
 *
 * Testnet only. Nothing here should ever be pointed at the public network —
 * these accounts are disposable and their secret keys are generated fresh
 * per run, in memory, and never persisted.
