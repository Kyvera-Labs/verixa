 * them back." Stellar's `MEMO_HASH` field is exactly 32 bytes — the exact
 * size of a SHA-256 digest, so the hash goes in whole, with no truncation
 * or encoding workaround. No Soroban contract, no token, no on-chain logic:
 * less to deploy, less to audit, and nothing that can be exploited beyond
 * the transaction itself.
 *
 * **Only ever anchor a hash.** A hash is a one-way commitment — it proves
 * the underlying record existed unchanged, while revealing nothing about
 * its contents. The audit log itself stays entirely in the operator's own
 * database. Putting audit *content* on a public ledger would be an
 * irreversible data leak, so this adapter accepts nothing but a validated
 * SHA-256 digest.
